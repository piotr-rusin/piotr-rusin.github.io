      <guid>https://piotr-rusin.github.io/projects/url-shortener/</guid>
      <description>An application for providing shorter aliases for given URLs. It uses my spam-lists library to prevent shortening of URLs recognized as spam or to warn users that an already existing shortened URL has been recognized as spam. The application also handles homoglyphs &amp;#8211; characters and sequences of characters similar to each other &amp;#8211; by internally treating them as identical, saving its users from inconvenience resulting from mistyping or misremembering shortened URLs with potentially confusing characters.</description>
