      <title>Changes in url-shortener</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/2016/08/introducing-my-url-shortener/&#34;&gt;When I introduced my URL shortener project&lt;/a&gt;, I already had a working version and I thought I only needed to improve its front-end to be able to release the first stable version of the application. I also had some ideas for new features to be added to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the longer I looked at my code, the more room for improvements I saw. Although I ended up adding some new features, most of the changes I made since then were refactorizations, changes in design and architecture of the application and code style improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;#8217;m going to describe some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I released the first stable version of spam-lists. It can be downloaded from github or PyPI.
In comparison to the version described in this post, the stable version contains some changes, mostly spelling error corrections and reformatting of docstrings. I have also changed the license of the project from Apache License 2.0 to MIT.</description>

      <title>Introducing my URL shortener</title>
      <link>https://piotr-rusin.github.io/2016/08/introducing-my-url-shortener/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;URL addresses can be quite long, mainly because they often consist of path and query components, both containing a number of characters forming names of path segments and values of parameters (not necessarily meaningful to a human reader), or performing other functions. For that reason, they may be hard to type and memorize, or simply aesthetically unpleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that, URL shorteners were created. There are plenty of them already, so there is probably no reason to create yet another such application, perhaps with one exception: it seems like an interesting idea for a small programming project that could be later extended with other features. This is why I decided to create &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/piotr-rusin/url-shortener&#34;&gt;my own URL shortener&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Progress in development of spam-lists</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of my spam-lists library on this blog, I made some progress in its development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reorganized the library a bit, changed the inheritance hierarchy of exception classes, fixed some errors and published the package on PyPI. In this post, I&amp;#8217;m going to describe the changes and explain my reasoning behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first project I would like to present on this blog is spam-lists (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/piotr-rusin/spam-lists&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;): a library for querying custom and third party web address blacklists and whitelists.&lt;/p&gt;
