      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/2016/12/a-php-symfony-blog-engine/&#34;&gt;one of my previous posts&lt;/a&gt; I described a blog engine I was developing. At the time, I had returned to it after a hiatus and I was convinced I would continue working on it. However, at the same time I was still more interested in developing my python-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/categories/url-shortener/&#34;&gt;url-shortener project&lt;/a&gt; and I also already planned moving on to other projects and technologies. As a result, I got bored of blog-engine again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve been focusing on Java and &lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/&#34;&gt;Spring Framework&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in a new project: another blog engine, but this time based on Spring and designed with different features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I started a blog engine project based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://symfony.com/&#34;&gt;Symfony framework&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve been adding things and making changes to it from time to time. Since August, I took a longer break in its development because I wanted to focus on other things, but now I&amp;#8217;m returning to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
