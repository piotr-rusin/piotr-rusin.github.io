    <p>I haven&rsquo;t posted here in a long time, although I&rsquo;ve been making some changes to this blog behind the scenes. One of the more recent (and more permanent) ones is switching to a different theme - this time it&rsquo;s a customized version of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/">Hyde</a>. Another big and permanent change is switching to a custom hosting and a custom domain - from now on, this blog will be available on <a href="https://reusingthewheel.net">reusingthewheel.net</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://piotr-rusin.github.io/">piotr-rusing.github.io</a> will still be up for a while, but probably not for long.</p>

I made some progress in both its front end and back end, and I would like to sum it up in this note</p>

    <p>I wanted to have greater control over my blog, so I&rsquo;ve been thinking about moving it to a self-hosted WordPress installation. In the end, I decided to migrate from WordPress to a static blog generated with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. This post will be the last one posted on <a href="https://reusingthewheel.wordpress.com/">reusingthewheel.wordpress.com</a> - the future ones will be posted on <a href="https://piotr-rusin.github.io">piotr-rusin.github.io</a>.</p>

    <p>Configurability and availability of multiple desktop environments and window managers are some of the things I like about using Linux-based operating systems. In recent months I gradually migrated from using full-fledged desktop environments like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(software)">Cinnamon</a> and <a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> to using <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a> in combination with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/rxvt-unicode">urxvt</a>, <a href="https://dunst-project.org/">dunst</a> and other applications commonly used with light window managers. While experimenting with their configuration, I discovered <a href="https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/">base16</a> and its derivative: <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-xresources">base16-xresources</a> – projects providing color schemes for syntax highlighting and application theming, each based on 16 colors.</p>

    I recently made some progress on Yule – my Spring Boot-based blog engine project – and now I have its first working version. The current features, installation, configuration and how to run the engine are all described in the README file in the repository of the project, so I won’t be covering them here.
My next steps in developing the engine will include:
 improving the front end refactoring the code by restructuring the configuration and moving repetitive code from controllers into common dependencies (including moving some data-manipulation code to some new service-layer classes).

    <p>Since my <a href="/posts/2017-05-16-a-new-blog-engine-project/">introductory post on Yule</a>, I’ve been doing some work on the project. I’ve implemented an automatic article publication feature as a part of service layer and I added some methods used by it to the repository layer of my project.</p>
<p>This post covers these changes and some problems I encountered during testing.</p>

    <p>In <a href="/posts/2016-12-06-a-php-symfony-blog-engine/">one of my previous posts</a> I described a blog engine I was developing. At the time, I had returned to it after a hiatus and I was convinced I would continue working on it. However, at the same time I was still more interested in developing my python-based <a href="https://reusingthewheel.net/projects/url-shortener/">url-shortener project</a> and I also already planned moving on to other projects and technologies. As a result, I got bored of blog-engine again.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve been focusing on Java and <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/">Spring Framework</a>. This resulted in a new project: another blog engine, but this time based on Spring and designed with different features.</p>

    <p>A demo instance of my url-shortener project is now available here:</p>
<p><a href="https://url-shortener.reusingthewheel.tk/">https://url-shortener.reusingthewheel.tk</a></p>
<p>Usually, URL shorteners are deployed under a short domain name (for example: <a href="https://goo.gl/">goo.gl</a>, <a href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a>). It’s not the case here, but since it’s just a demo I didn’t think looking for a short domain for it was necessary, so I chose a longer domain that is also related to my blog.</p>
<p>I have also made some changes to the application. Some of them were minor, like adjusting font sizes in the front end, renaming some local variables in the back end, etc., but there are also some bigger changes.</p>

    <p><a href="/posts/2016-08-05-introducing-my-url-shortener/">When I introduced my URL shortener project</a>, I already had a working version and I thought I only needed to improve its front-end to be able to release the first stable version of the application. I also had some ideas for new features to be added to it.</p>
<p>However, the longer I looked at my code, the more room for improvements I saw. Although I ended up adding some new features, most of the changes I made since then were refactorizations, changes in design and architecture of the application and code style improvements.</p>
<p>In this post, I’m going to describe some of them.</p>

    I released the first stable version of spam-lists. It can be downloaded from github or PyPI.
In comparison to the version described in this post, the stable version contains some changes, mostly spelling error corrections and reformatting of docstrings. I have also changed the license of the project from Apache License 2.0 to MIT.

    <p>URL addresses can be quite long, mainly because they often consist of path and query components, both containing a number of characters forming names of path segments and values of parameters (not necessarily meaningful to a human reader), or performing other functions. For that reason, they may be hard to type and memorize, or simply aesthetically unpleasing.</p>
<p>Because of that, URL shorteners were created. There are plenty of them already, so there is probably no reason to create yet another such application, perhaps with one exception: it seems like an interesting idea for a small programming project that could be later extended with other features. This is why I decided to create <a href="https://github.com/piotr-rusin/url-shortener">my own URL shortener</a>.</p>
