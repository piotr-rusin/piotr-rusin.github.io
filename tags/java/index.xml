      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently went back to developing &lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/categories/yule/&#34;&gt;Yule&lt;/a&gt; - my blog engine project based, among others, on &lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/&#34;&gt;the Spring Boot framework&lt;/a&gt;. I made some progress in both its front end and back end, and I would like to sum it up in this note&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I recently made some progress on Yule &amp;#8211; my Spring Boot-based blog engine project &amp;#8211; and now I have its first working version. The current features, installation, configuration and how to run the engine are all described in the README file in the repository of the project, so I won&amp;#8217;t be covering them here.
My next steps in developing the engine will include:
 improving the front end refactoring the code by restructuring the configuration and moving repetitive code from controllers into common dependencies (including moving some data-manipulation code to some new service-layer classes).</description>

      <title>Implementing service layer for Yule</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my &lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/2017/05/a-new-blog-engine-project/&#34;&gt;introductory post on Yule&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing some work on the project. I&amp;#8217;ve implemented an automatic article publication feature as a part of service layer and I added some methods used by it to the repository layer of my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post covers these changes and some problems I encountered during testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A new blog engine project</title>
      <link>https://piotr-rusin.github.io/2017/05/a-new-blog-engine-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/2016/12/a-php-symfony-blog-engine/&#34;&gt;one of my previous posts&lt;/a&gt; I described a blog engine I was developing. At the time, I had returned to it after a hiatus and I was convinced I would continue working on it. However, at the same time I was still more interested in developing my python-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/categories/url-shortener/&#34;&gt;url-shortener project&lt;/a&gt; and I also already planned moving on to other projects and technologies. As a result, I got bored of blog-engine again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve been focusing on Java and &lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/&#34;&gt;Spring Framework&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in a new project: another blog engine, but this time based on Spring and designed with different features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
