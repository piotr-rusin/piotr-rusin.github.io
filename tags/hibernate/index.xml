      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/posts/2016-12-06-a-php-symfony-blog-engine/&#34;&gt;one of my previous posts&lt;/a&gt; I described a blog engine I was developing. At the time, I had returned to it after a hiatus and I was convinced I would continue working on it. However, at the same time I was still more interested in developing my python-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/projects/url-shortener/&#34;&gt;url-shortener project&lt;/a&gt; and I also already planned moving on to other projects and technologies. As a result, I got bored of blog-engine again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Iâ€™ve been focusing on Java and &lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/&#34;&gt;Spring Framework&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in a new project: another blog engine, but this time based on Spring and designed with different features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
