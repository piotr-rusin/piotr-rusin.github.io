      <title>Introducing my URL shortener</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;URL addresses can be quite long, mainly because they often consist of path and query components, both containing a number of characters forming names of path segments and values of parameters (not necessarily meaningful to a human reader), or performing other functions. For that reason, they may be hard to type and memorize, or simply aesthetically unpleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, URL shorteners were created. There are plenty of them already, so there is probably no reason to create yet another such application, perhaps with one exception: it seems like an interesting idea for a small programming project that could be later extended with other features. This is why I decided to create &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/piotr-rusin/url-shortener&#34;&gt;my own URL shortener&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
