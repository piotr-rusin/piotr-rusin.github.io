      <description>I recently made some progress on Yule &amp;#8211; my Spring Boot-based blog engine project &amp;#8211; and now I have its first working version. The current features, installation, configuration and how to run the engine are all described in the README file in the repository of the project, so I won&amp;#8217;t be covering them here.
My next steps in developing the engine will include:
 improving the front end refactoring the code by restructuring the configuration and moving repetitive code from controllers into common dependencies (including moving some data-manipulation code to some new service-layer classes).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my &lt;a href=&#34;https://piotr-rusin.github.io/2017/05/a-new-blog-engine-project/&#34;&gt;introductory post on Yule&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing some work on the project. I&amp;#8217;ve implemented an automatic article publication feature as a part of service layer and I added some methods used by it to the repository layer of my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post covers these changes and some problems I encountered during testing.&lt;/p&gt;
