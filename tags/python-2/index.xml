      <description>I released the first stable version of spam-lists. It can be downloaded from github or PyPI.
In comparison to the version described in this post, the stable version contains some changes, mostly spelling error corrections and reformatting of docstrings. I have also changed the license of the project from Apache License 2.0 to MIT.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of my spam-lists library on this blog, I made some progress in its development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reorganized the library a bit, changed the inheritance hierarchy of exception classes, fixed some errors and published the package on PyPI. In this post, I&amp;#8217;m going to describe the changes and explain my reasoning behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first project I would like to present on this blog is spam-lists (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/piotr-rusin/spam-lists&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;): a library for querying custom and third party web address blacklists and whitelists.&lt;/p&gt;
