  <h1>A PHP/Symfony blog engine</h1>
  <time datetime=2016-12-06T13:33:10Z class="post-date">Tue, Dec 6, 2016</time>
  <p>A few months ago I started a blog engine project based on <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony framework</a>. I’ve been adding things and making changes to it from time to time. Since August, I took a longer break in its development because I wanted to focus on other things, but now I’m returning to the project.</p>
<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
<p>The core feature of each blogging software is the ability to manage and publish articles or blog posts. Each of them should obviously have a title and content.</p>
<p>It is also useful for an article to have a slug that represents it in URL addresses. It will generally be based on the title of an article, but it’s good to be able to replace a generated slug with a custom value so that it would be shorter or work better with search engines.</p>
<p>The following data will also be stored and managed for each article:</p>
<ul>
<li>author</li>
<li>comments</li>
<li>tags</li>
<li>date of publication</li>
<li>publication status marking the article as published or not published</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="users">Users</h2>
<p>The blog engine will support user registration and the following user roles, each with their own privileges:</p>
<ul>
<li>contributor – creating and editing their own articles, but not publishing them</li>
<li>author – creating their own articles, editing and publishing them</li>
<li>editor – creating, publishing and editing their own articles, publishing and editing articles authored by other users</li>
<li>admin – access to all administration features for an installation of the engine</li>
<li>moderator – hiding comments made by other users, or publishing them if new comment moderation is turned on</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a super admin role provided by an external library, but I probably won’t use it.</p>
<p>The roles are organized in a <a href="https://github.com/piotr-rusin/blog-engine/blob/master/app/config/security.yml#L12">hierarchy</a>. Its design relies on comment moderation and content creation/blog administration privileges being separate so that, for example, a user could be either an editor or a moderator, or both. The admin role is an exception: each admin is also a moderator.</p>
<p>Other than user roles, the application will store and manage the following data for each user:</p>
<ul>
<li>comments written by them</li>
<li>articles authored by them</li>
<li>username</li>
<li>email address</li>
<li>encrypted password</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p>Most blog engines allow users to publish comments under articles, either by handling all comment-related data storage and management themselves or by using third party commenting services and plugins, like Disqus. For this project, I will implement this feature myself.</p>
<p>The following data will be stored and managed for each comment:</p>
<ul>
<li>publication date</li>
<li>publication status – specifying if the comment is currently published (visible) or not</li>
<li>article under which the comment was posted</li>
<li>data of the author of the comment</li>
</ul>
<p>Like WordPress and Blogger, my blog engine will allow commenting for both authenticated and non-authenticated users – a user who just wants to post a comment on an article will be able to do so without having to register, log in and remember or store somewhere their password. Still, such a user will have to provide a username and email address to be able to comment.</p>
<h2 id="storage-and-representation-of-entities">Storage and representation of entities</h2>
<p>For database storage and object mapping I decided to use Doctrine ORM and PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>Blog articles, tags, users and comments are represented by <a href="https://github.com/piotr-rusin/blog-engine/tree/master/src/AppBundle/Entity">entity classes</a> that are mapped to rows of their respective tables. Doctrine provides the following options for specifying mapping information:</p>
<ul>
<li>YAML files</li>
<li>XML files</li>
<li>DocBlock annotations</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose to use the annotations because I prefer defining metadata as close to entity classes and their mapped properties as possible.</p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle">FOSUSerBundle</a> as a library providing features related to user registration and authentication, instead of implementing them myself. My own user entity class extends one provided by the library and adds project-specific features: <code>comments</code> and <code>articles</code> properties containing posts authored by a user.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-the-project">The future of the project</h2>
<p>The next steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating form classes for articles, tags and user roles</li>
<li>creating voters for authorization based on task type, user role and other criteria</li>
<li>adding controller classes and implementing methods for handling HTTP requests</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some decisions I made soon after starting the project which I’m now reconsidering – particularly ones related to the user role hierarchy. I will explain everything in the next article about the project, once I decide on possible changes.</p>
